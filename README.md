# Work Day Scheduler - Challenge 5

This project is the fifth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

Starting with basic starter code, this challenge required writing additional code to do the following:
* when I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top
* when I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* when I view the time blocks for that day, each block is color coded to indicate whether it is past, present, or future
* when I click into a time block, then I can enter an event
* when I click the save button for a time block, the text for the event is saved to local storage
* when I refresh the page, the saved events persist

## Made Using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Luxon API (replacing moment.js)
